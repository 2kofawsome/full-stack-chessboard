A true full stack developer not only runs the database and the website, but builds every part of their project. 

If you do not turn the chess pieces on the lathe and solder the reed switches yourself, how can you ever claim full stack for just running the Raspberry Pi.


This project will include: 

> An Electrical Engineering component of wiring it all up

> A Wood Working component with turning the pieces and building the board

> A Software component with coding the brains on a Raspberry Pi Zero

> A back end component with the database of past games and running the website server on another Raspberry Pi (3B+)

> Front end componenet of building the website visuals

Now that's full stack
